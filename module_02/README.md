# Week 2 instructions

## Execute both the instruction and assignment notebooks
*(Time: approx 3 hours)*

I <b>expect</b> you to complete `02_matplotlib.ipynb` before our class meeting. I <b> encourage</b> you to begin `02_application.ipynb` before our meeting, but we will go over the material in class. 

You will turn in `02_application.ipynb` a week after our class meeting about the assignment. If you would like a challenge (perhaps you have taken a Python course already), you can also try `02_application_advanced.ipynb`
