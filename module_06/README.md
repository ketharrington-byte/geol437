# Save your fork before fetching any updates from the main branch
When you want to send your ongoing work to your remote repository as a safeguard against losing work:

`git add .` (adds all file changes to a “bundle” of work)

`git commit -m "[a useful message]" `

`git push` (send these updates to student remote repo)

And when you need to incorporate updates I make:

`git fetch upstream`

`git merge upstream/main`

# Read online textbook
You <b>must</b> read [Chapter 5](https://pythongis.org/part2/chapter-05/index.html) and [Chapter 6](https://pythongis.org/part2/chapter-06/index.html).

# Examine the two notebooks in the `module_06` directory
*(Time: approx 2 hours)*


I <b>expect</b> you to complete `05_spatial_operations.ipynb` before our class meeting on the 7th, and I bet it won't take more than 2 hours. I <b>strongly encourage</b> you to look through `05_application.ipynb` before class, but we will work together on the assignment.
