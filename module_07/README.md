# Save your fork before fetching any updates from the main branch
When you want to send your ongoing work to your remote repository as a safeguard against losing work:

`git add . (adds all file changes to a “bundle” of work)`

`git commit -m "[a useful message]" `

`git push (send these updates to student remote repo)`

And when you need to incorporate updates I make:

`git fetch upstream`

`git merge upstream/main`

# Examine notebooks
