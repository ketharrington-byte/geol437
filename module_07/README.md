# Save your fork before fetching any updates from the main branch
When you want to send your ongoing work to your remote repository as a safeguard against losing work:

`git add .` (adds all file changes to a “bundle” of work)

`git commit -m "[a useful message]" `

`git push` (send these updates to student remote repo)

And when you need to incorporate updates I make:

`git fetch upstream`

`git merge upstream/main`

# Read the docs
Read [An Introduction to `seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/introduction.html) before beginning the coding activities. 

# Examine notebooks
Complete the `07_statistics.ipynb` notebook before class, and begin `07_applied.ipynb` before class and come with your questions.
