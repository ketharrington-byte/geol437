Plan it out: take a few minutes to envision what your “perfect plot” would look like. What data are on the X and Y axes? Would this data best be shown as a scatterplot? Line plot? Bar plot? Try sketching out the ideal plot, and use symbols or different shading to denote colors and symbols that might change with data properties. 
Now, work backwards from here to figure out how you will construct this plot using the tools you’ve learned so far. Will you have one dataset on one axis object? Two plots on one axis? Two axes? Will you need to specify a c-axis? 
Once you’ve worked through the logical planning of the plot mechanics, now it’s time to think of any tasks related to the data itself. Do you need to perform any transformations to the raw data to achieve those results? Calculations? Unit conversions? Statistical analyses? Maybe you have many datasets and you’d rather plot the mean of each population against another variable – how might you go about doing that, and in what order? These are all aspects of data reduction, which is just the fancy term for going from raw data to a plot that a non-expert might understand, or that tells a specific story about your data.
