# Week 3 instructions
## Run `git pull` to update the class repo with the latest assignments
1. On the JupyterHub, navigate to the Terminal and use `cd geol437` to enter that directory
2. Run `git pull` to <i>pull</i> updates from the remote repo to your local repo 
3. Do this every week to ensure your files are up to date for the class. 
## Execute all of `03_pandas_intro.ipynb`
*(Time: approx 1 hour)*

Nothing to turn in for a grade here, just execute all of the code blocks and understand what each one does (and ask Joanmarie for assistance if you need it)
